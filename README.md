# Data Science Projects

Welcome to my **Data Science Projects** repository! This collection represents a series of projects developed as part of my academic exploration into data science. The goal of this repository is to build a portfolio that showcases my skills, insights, and learning experiences in the field. Each project includes a README file summarizing the work, skills demonstrated, and links to the relevant code and data.

## Project Overview: 10 Engaging Projects (7 Completed + 3 In Progress)

1) **[K-Means Clustering of Healthy Habits (Exploratory Segmentation)](projects/Healthy-Habits-Clustering.md)**  
   - **Summary:** This project standardizes daily habit metrics (exercise, sleep, meetings, etc.) and applies K-Means clustering to explore segments associated with reported end-of-day moods. Outputs include elbow plots, cluster labels, and pairwise visualizations.

2) **[Childcare in America: Affordability Analysis (Communication & EDA)](projects/Childcare-Affordability.md)**  
   - **Summary:** Utilizing the National Database of Child Care Prices, this project engineers affordability metrics (e.g., cost as a share of median family income). It compares metrics across states and segments, visualizes rankings and distributions, and synthesizes implications for stakeholders.

3) **Cardiovascular Risk Modeling with FHS (Binary Classification)**  
   - **Summary:** This work involves developing baseline logistic and tree models to estimate 10-year cardiovascular risk, comparing various metrics and calibration techniques.

4) **Collectibles Market Data Ingestion Pipeline (Web/Data Parsing)**  
   - **Summary:** In this project, robust parsers and schema normalization techniques are implemented to assemble datasets for downstream pricing analytics.

5) **Galactic Figures ETL and Analytics (Domain ETL)**  
   - **Summary:** This project includes parsing, merging, and pivoting techniques to create analysis-ready datasets and summary views.

6) **Housing & Population Modeling (Regression/Forecasting)**  
   - **Summary:** This project involves exploratory data analysis (EDA) and modeling on housing and population data, including baseline regressors with diagnostics and error analysis.

7) **Data Storytelling End-to-End (Multi-Format Communication)**  
   - **Summary:** A narrative-driven analysis packaged across various media formats, emphasizing clarity, visuals, and effective stakeholder framing.

8) **Modeling Pure Premium in Auto Insurance Using GLMs and Python** 
   - **Source:** [Pure Premium GLM](pure-premium-glm/Pure-Premium-GLM.md)
   - **Summary:** This project aims to utilize Generalized Linear Models to build and evaluate insurance pricing models incorporating domain-specific features.

9) **[Placeholder] Project 2 - Approval Pending - Comparative Analysis of Modeling Methods to Predict Fuel Efficiency**  
   - **Source:** [Estimating MPG](estimating-mpg/Estimating-MPG.md)  
   - **Summary:** This project aims to compare various modeling techniques to predict miles per gallon (MPG) based on vehicle characteristics such as weight, cylinders, and horsepower. Techniques include linear regression, decision trees, and ensemble methods.

10) **[Placeholder] Project 3**  
    - **Source:** `DSC680_T301_Fall2025`  
    - **Summary:** Details to be determined as this project is further developed.
