# Data-Science-Projects
Data Science Projects created during my graduate studies at Bellevue University.  I am working on this repository to build out a portfolio of projects that demonstrate my skills and experience in data science.  Each project will include a README file that summarizes the project, the skills demonstrated, and links to the relevant code and data.


## 10 proposed portfolio projects (7 existing + 3 placeholders for current course)

1) [K-Means Clustering of Healthy Habits (exploratory segmentation)](projects/Healthy-Habits-Clustering.md)
  - Summary: Standardized daily habit metrics (exercise, sleep, meetings, time proxy) and applied K-Means (k=3 via elbow) to explore segments associated with reported end-of-day mood; outputs include elbow plot, cluster labels, and pairwise visuals.

2) [Childcare in America: Affordability Analysis (communication & EDA)](projects/Childcare-Affordability.md)
  - Summary: Used the National Database of Child Care Prices to engineer affordability metrics (e.g., cost as a share of median family income), compare across states and segments, visualize rankings/distributions, and synthesize implications for decision-makers.

3) Cardiovascular Risk Modeling with FHS (binary classification)
   - Summary: Train baseline logistic/tree models to estimate 10-year risk; compare metrics and calibration.

4) Collectibles Market Data Ingestion Pipeline (web/data parsing)
   - Summary: Robust parsers, schema normalization, and dataset assembly for downstream pricing analytics.

5) Galactic Figures ETL and Analytics (domain ETL)
   - Summary: Parse, merge, and pivot pipelines to create analysis-ready datasets and summary views.

6) Housing & Population Modeling (regression/forecasting)
   - Summary: EDA and modeling on housing/population data; baseline regressors with diagnostics and error analysis.

7) Data Storytelling End-to-End (multi-format communication)
   - Summary: Narrative-driven analysis packaged across media; emphasizes clarity, visuals, and stakeholder framing.

8) [Placeholder] General Linearized Model (Insurance Pricing)
   - Source: `DSC680_T301_Fall2025`.
   - Summary: Use Glum to build and evaluate insurance pricing models with domain-specific features.

9) [Placeholder] Production ML API (serving & CI)
   - Source: `DSC680_T301_Fall2025`.
   - Summary: TBD

10) [Placeholder] Interactive Monitoring Dashboard (observability)
    - Source: `DSC680_T301_Fall2025`.
    - Summary: TBD
