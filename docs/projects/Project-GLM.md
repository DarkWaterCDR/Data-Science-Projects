excerpt: "This project is an exploration of Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) for estimating Pure Premium in Auto Insurance Pricing using the French Motor TPL dataset.  We explore Frequency (Poisson) x Severity (Gamma) and Tweedie Modeling approaches, comparing model performance, calibration, and interpretability.  We use the glum library in python to implement the models.  The project contains an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and a Modeling Jupyter Notebook as well as a White Paper summarizing the effort.

# Pure Premium GLM

## Synopsis
- Purpose: Explore how Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) can be applied to estimate Pure Premium in Auto Insurance Pricing.
- Methods: Used French Motor TPL dataset to compare models using Poisson, Negative Binomial, Gamma, and Tweedie GLMs.
- Scope: Comparative study focused on model transparency, calibration, and interpretability.

## Skills demonstrated (career-focused)
- Data wrangling and feature engineering (type conversion, categorical encoding, scaling)
- GLM Modeling
- Experiment Automation
- Model Diagnostics and Evaluation
