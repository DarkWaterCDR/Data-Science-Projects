# Draft README 2 â€” Childcare in America (A Review of NDCP Data)

## Synopsis
- Purpose: Assess the affordability of child care in the U.S. using the National Database of Child Care Prices, highlighting differences by state and segment (e.g., age groups) to inform policy and family decision-making.
- Methods: Cleaned and aligned state-level tables; engineered affordability metrics (e.g., child care cost as a share of median family income); aggregated and compared results across states/segments; visualized distributions and rankings; summarized insights in a concise narrative.
- Scope: Exploratory analysis and communication artifacts focused on affordability patterns and implications.

## Skills demonstrated (career-focused)
- Data wrangling and documentation alignment with a public dataset
- Feature engineering for affordability metrics and geographic/segment aggregation
- Exploratory analysis and stakeholder-ready visualization (rankings, distributions; map if applicable)
- Insight synthesis and storytelling with assumptions/limitations and actionable recommendations
- Reproducible workflow in Python notebooks (pandas, seaborn/matplotlib) and/or BI tooling (e.g., Tableau)
