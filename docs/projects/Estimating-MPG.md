excerpt: "This project provides a comparative analysis between different methods of estimating fuel efficiency from vehicle characteristics.  The project seeks to explore the effectiveness of various regression techniques in predicting miles per gallon (MPG) based on features such as engine size, weight, and horsepower.  We will use comparative metrics and model pipelines to explore the efficiency and explanability of linear regression, decision trees, random forest, and gradient boosting methods."

# Estimating MPG

## Synopsis
- Purpose: Explore how various regression techniques can be applied to estimate fuel efficiency (MPG) from vehicle characteristics.
- Methods: Used the UCI Auto MPG dataset to compare Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting models.
- Scope: Comparative study focused on predictive accuracy, model interpretability, and computational efficiency.

## Skills demonstrated (career-focused)
- Data analysis and feature engineering (type conversion, categorical encoding, scaling)
- Regression Modeling
- Experiment Automation
- Model Diagnostics and Evaluation
